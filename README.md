# RandomUsers

RandomUsers is a sample Android application with the main goal of show my clean architecture approach, using several Architecture Components from [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack), to do the following:
* Get a paged list of random users from a paged API, save them in a local database, and show the list on screen
* Load more users on scroll
* See the user details on click
* Mark users as favorites
* Show favorite users
* *TODO: delete users on swipe, and undo the deletion*

## Architecture & libraries
I used the following architecture, patterns and libraries:
* [Clean Architecture](https://proandroiddev.com/clean-architecture-data-flow-dependency-rule-615ffdd79e29)
* [MVVM](https://proandroiddev.com/mvvm-architecture-viewmodel-and-livedata-part-1-604f50cda1) pattern in presentation layer, using [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel?gclid=CjwKCAjwwtTmBRBqEiwA-b6c_xzTC-8dos110OOgVQtVX2pFi1lNuJ7M4ZDlZo78pG2gFcQgAYyrIRoCOLAQAvD_BwE) and [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
* [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) for concurrency in domain and data layers
* [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) for dependency injection
* [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) (Architecture component)
* [Android Paging Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/) for pagination
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for networking, to retrieve data from [Random user generator](https://randomuser.me/)
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) for database
* [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) for logging
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) for loading images
